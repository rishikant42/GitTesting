How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Seeing the diff between two versions of a file help me see the bug if in a version of a file have a functional code. 
So I could to use it.
The automated process to find the difference help us to avoid to lost time trying to find the bug and back to the previous version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

The easy access to the entire history of the file help us to walk again the thinking process and analyzing and fixing the mistake.
Maybe the half way is right, and then just a part of the work would be remade.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Manually Commit 
Pros: manually commit give me the power of commit the changes when I guess better and when a step up was given. 
Cons: maybe I could to forget to commit. Maybe I could to commit too much often 

Automatically Commit 
Pros: It's avoid the programmer to forget to commit; 
Cons: Maybe the automatically machine Commit are saving just a piece of the logic and the code do not compile.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It happened because it was builded to be a repository of code and Docs and others don't.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Using the git log I can see the history of commits. 
Using the git diff I can compare two commits and see the changes made.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It´s make me more confident to make changes because it allowed to return to the previous state after the change

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

My projects, I guess
