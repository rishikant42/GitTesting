Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A. You would do this when you want to work with other people.

------------------

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. Pulling changes manually is always safer than making having Git automatically do it.
There might be things added which you do not want in your branch.

------------------

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A. Fork - create a version of the repo to work from. doesn't affect the original version of the repo
   Clone - create a local copy of a repo. carry out changes, push to it
   Branch - create a branch to work on seperate to the 'master' branch

------------------

Q. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

A. If there is ever a problem with merging, it's useful to see the last known
state.

-----------------

Q. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be 
easier, and what would be harder?

A. It would be very hard. A lot of manual labour involved, talking, emails 
etc. Finding conflicts would be difficult and working at the same time would
almost be impossible.

------------------

Q. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than 
directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

A. When you're making a new feature which you want to test before merging
straight in. You can leave the master branch in-tact, unaffected. You can test
you're changes before finally merging them into master.
