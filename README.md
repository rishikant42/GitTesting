```
GitHub is the place to host your repos and collaborate with people
Github is free `Git` hosting service

And Git, itself, being the version control tool that GitHub is built on.

So, Git is largely the thing that will be interacting with on the laptop.

Doing local work first (with git) and as soon as we use a few choice commands and
send things up to GitHub that's when it's more the social component or
it's in it's network, it's in a cloud if you wanted to use that term as well.

So Git is local.
GitHub is where we share and collaborate with other people.
